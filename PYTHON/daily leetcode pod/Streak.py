# 2094  finding 3-digit even numbers



# Input: digits = [2,1,3,0]
# Output: [102,120,130,132,210,230,302,310,312,320]
# Explanation: All the possible integers that follow the requirements are in the output array. 
# Notice that there are no odd integers or integers with leading zeros.

#3335 - total characters in string after transformations I

# Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2

# Output: 7

# Explanation:

# First Transformation (t = 1):
# 'a' becomes 'b'
# 'b' becomes 'c'
# 'c' becomes 'd'
# 'y' becomes 'z'
# 'y' becomes 'z'
# String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
# Second Transformation (t = 2):
# 'b' becomes 'c'
# 'c' becomes 'd'
# 'd' becomes 'e'
# 'z' becomes "ab"
# 'z' becomes "ab"
# String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
# Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.
